[Chinese version 中文版](README_CN.md)

This mod is used to remove the anti-cheat system from the modpack "Dangerous World". 

It should feel like a seamless experience, since all anti-cheat checks that I can find are removed.

Aside from that, we added a new command `/overwrite_enable_command enable me` which you can use to enable cheat for a single player world where commands are not enabled when creating the world 
because of the anti-cheat system. It is not a good patch. I still recommend you to use NBT editors to enable cheats in single player worlds after it is created. This trick works but is not recommended
simply because it is not elegant. Since the level data is read-only, so I cannot modify that without mixining too much of the code.
I believe you can still download some mods with allows you to do that directly. 

Note: This mod is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by the creators of the "Dangerous World" modpack. 
It is not intended for malicious use, but rather to provide users with more control over their gaming experience.
I haven't received any complaints about this mod from the modpack creators as of now.
Please do not mention this mod without my permission in the modpack's discussion forums or issue trackers.
(I am okay with private sharing or sharing in unofficial channels.)
And be respectful to the original modpack creators, and others in this community.

I wish you all the best.
